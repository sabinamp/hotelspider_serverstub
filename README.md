# Swagger generated server

This a Spring Boot with Maven project. As described below, the original server stub has been generated from  https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Hotel-Spider/hotel_spider_crs_api/2.0. Both a client stub for Android and a server stub have been generated for use in Bedwaste application. However they had to be adjusted to the needs of the app. 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
